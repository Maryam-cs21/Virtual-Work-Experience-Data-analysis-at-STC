# Virtual Work Experience with STC - Data Analysis Tasks

Welcome to the repository containing four data analysis projects developed during my virtual work experience with STC. This collection showcases various data analysis techniques and tools used to derive insights from data.



## 1. First Task : User Behavior Analysis
This project analyzes user behavior using a dataset containing information on program interactions. The dataset includes columns for user IDs, program names, durations, and more. The goal is to identify patterns in user engagement and preferences.


## 2. Second Task: Predicting Customer Behavior
This project focuses on predicting user behavior for the next two months using the Prophet algorithm. By analyzing historical user interaction data, the model forecasts future engagement trends, helping to identify anticipated user preferences and behaviors.


## 3. Third Task: Recommendation Systems
Theis project is designed to analyze user behavior and preferences in consuming movies and TV shows. By utilizing a dataset that details customer interactions with various programs, this project aims to build a recommendation engine that suggests personalized content to users on the Jawwy platform.

## 4. Fourth Task: Data Representation
Showcase the findings.
